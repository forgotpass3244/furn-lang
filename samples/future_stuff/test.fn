# additionally if the symbol is mutable
# it will begin with _PKGv instead of _PKG

# the runtime looks for the _PKG_main_main symbol
# so the package that contains the main function
# must also be named main

# the package statement can be anywhere
# since the symbol names are printed
# after generating IR
# so it will add the _PKG_pkgname_exportname
# after IR gen
# and non-exported globals will not be mangled
package main;

# import system
# explicit 'package' keyword required after 'import'
# since i will add modules in the future that get lexed and parsed
# within the same file its imported into

# its last evaluated
# (blocks are expressions)
